# Define a class Person with:

#  - An attribute first_name
#  - An attribute last_name
#  - An attribute birthdate (we just assign a string to this attribute, e.g. "April 19, 1987")
#  - An instance method, full_name, that puts first_name and last_name together
#  - An instance method, age, that calculates the number of years between today and birthdate

class Person
  require("date")
  attr_accessor :first_name
  attr_accessor :last_name
  attr_accessor :birthdate
  def full_name
    return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
  end
  def age
    dob = Date.parse(self.birthdate)
    now = Date.today
    age_in_days = now - dob
    age_in_years = age_in_days / 365 + 1

    return age_in_years.to_i
  end
